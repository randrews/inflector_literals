InflectorLiterals
=================

When you call String#humanize, it calls capitalize on the result. This means that something like "ip_address".humanize returns "Ip address" instead of "IP address".

I added a method to ActiveSupport::Inflector::Inflections called literal, that lets you specify exactly what humans expect to read for a field name.

Example
=======

in inflections.rb:

ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections do |inflect|
    inflect.literal "po_number", "PO number"
end

Thenceforth:

"po_number".humanize ==> "PO number"
